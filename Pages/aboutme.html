    <h2 id="INTRO">Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        I’m a curious and driven individual with a strong passion for business, accounting, and continuous learning. I enjoy solving complex problems—whether through analytical thinking, exploring new business strategies, or even tackling puzzles in my free time. With a background that combines creativity and discipline, I also play the violin, which has helped me develop focus and attention to detail. I genuinely enjoy school and am always seeking new opportunities to grow intellectually and professionally.
    </p>

    <h2 id="PIV">Personal Insights and Values</h2>
    <h4>Lifelong Learning</h4>
    <p>
        I strongly value continuous learning and personal growth. Whether through formal education, certifications, or independent study, I believe staying curious and open to new knowledge is essential for both personal and professional development.
    </p>
    <h4>Integrity and Accountability</h4>
    <p>
        I believe in doing the right thing—even when no one is watching. Integrity and accountability are values I hold deeply, and I strive to reflect them in every project, relationship, and decision I make.
    </p>
    <h4>Discipline and Focus</h4>
    <p>
        Discipline has always been a core part of my success, whether it’s mastering a piece on the violin or working through a complex business analysis. I value staying focused, setting goals, and following through with consistency and care.
    </p>
    <h4>Curiosity and Problem-Solving</h4>
    <p>
        I’m naturally curious and love tackling challenges. I enjoy digging into problems, asking questions, and finding smart, practical solutions—especially in areas like business strategy and analytics.
    </p>
    <h4>Collaboration and Respect</h4>
    <p>
        I believe the best ideas come from collaboration and respectful dialogue. I value listening to others, sharing knowledge, and building strong relationships that lead to meaningful results.
    </p>
    <h4>Excellence and Growth Mindset</h4>
    <p>
        I aim for excellence in everything I do but also understand the importance of learning from failure. A growth mindset helps me stay resilient and constantly improve.
    </p>

    <h2 id="HOB">Hobbies</h2>
    <h4>Puzzles & Problem-Solving</h4>
    <p>
        I enjoy logic puzzles, brainteasers, and strategy games that challenge my thinking and improve my ability to approach problems from different angles. This hobby complements my interest in analytics and strategic planning.
    </p>
    <h4>Playing the Violin</h4>
    <p>
        Music has been a meaningful part of my life for years. Playing the violin has taught me discipline, focus, and the value of consistent practice—skills that carry over into both academic and professional environments.
    </p>
    <h4>Learning & Self-Education</h4>
    <p>
        I have a genuine love for learning. Whether it's through formal courses, certifications, or independent study, I enjoy exploring new topics—especially those related to business, finance, and technology.
    </p>
    <h4>Sports Enthusiast</h4>
    <p>
        While not my primary focus, I enjoy watching and occasionally playing football and basketball. These interests help me relax and appreciate teamwork, strategy, and competition in a low-pressure setting.
    </p>
    <h4>Listening to Music</h4>
    <p>
        I enjoy listening to music throughout the day, especially jazz, big band, bossa nova, and classical. Music helps me focus, stay creative, and unwind—it’s a constant source of energy and inspiration.

    <h4>Reading</h4>
    <p>
        I enjoy classic literature and thought-provoking works. Some of my favorites are Lord of the Flies, Animal Farm, Othello, and The Autobiography of Andrew Carnegie. Reading helps me learn, reflect, and expand my perspective.

    <h2 id="PI">Personal Interests</h2>
    <p>
        My personal interests are driven by a deep passion for learning and a relentless work ethic. I’m inspired by music, from jazz and big band to bossa nova and classical, which helps me stay focused and creative. Reading, especially classic literature and biographies like Lord of the Flies, Animal Farm, Othello, and The Autobiography of Andrew Carnegie, fuels my desire for personal growth and understanding of leadership. With aspirations to one day become the CEO of my own business and venture into real estate, I’m constantly seeking knowledge and applying hard work to turn these goals into reality. Every challenge is an opportunity to learn and grow, and I approach each day with the drive to achieve.
